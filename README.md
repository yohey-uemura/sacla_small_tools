# sacla_small_tools
small python scripts for XAS measurements at SACLA
This project includes utilities for XAS measurements at SACLA. The python scripts are written only using the native python libraries.
- calc_custom_steps.py: the script can create custom scan steps and save them into a file
- convE2Angle.py: convert the motor value of the channel-cut monochrometer to the corresponding energy value (other way around is also possible)
